# SEMESTER-FEE
This is for my FUTURE READY TALENT project
<h1>JNTUK FEE PORTAL</h1>
This is a responsive fee payment website which I built using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT. The website is responsive such that it is suitable to handle the website in any of the device with any dimensions. I deployed my website using Microsoft azure <strong> STATIC WEB APPS</strong>.

<h2>INTRO PAGE</h2>
The opening of the website looks like,

<h2>FUNCTIONALITY OF WEBPAGE</h2>
Here I used the website as to fill in the sem fee of my college which is <strong>JNTUK</strong>.The website supports and identifies all different types of debit cards based on the card number.
<br>
The cards which the webpage can identify are
<ul>
<li>VISA</li>
<li>MASTERCARD</li>
<li>AMEX</li>
<li>DISCOVER</li>
<li>PAYPAL</li>
</ul>

I scripted the js file such that the website can identify which card is being entered by the client. For instance, if I am entering a card of type <strong>VISA</strong>, then the small icon in the card number bar pops up with the symbol representing VISA card.

and on filling the entire card number if the entered card number is correct then the tick icon will turn green.

<br>
Let us take another example, for say MASTERCARD it can sure identify the card.

In this way, my website can be used to fill the fee-payments of the semester fee.
